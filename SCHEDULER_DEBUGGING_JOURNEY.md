# Sleep Trainer Scheduler: Debugging Journey & Solutions

## Overview
This document chronicles the extensive debugging process for the Sleep Trainer smart plug scheduler, focusing on the challenging "refresh issue" where manual device control would be overridden by automatic scheduling on page refreshes.

## Initial Problem Statement

### Core Requirements
1. **Scheduled Automation**: Lights turn on/off at specific times based on work/rest day schedules
2. **Manual Override**: User can manually control lights anytime  
3. **State Persistence**: Manual changes should stick until the next scheduled event
4. **No Refresh Interference**: Page refresh shouldn't change device state

### The Main Issue
- User would manually turn lights OFF
- Page refresh would immediately turn lights back ON
- Made manual control completely unreliable

## Debugging Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Tuya API Integration Issues

**Problem**: Wrong device endpoints and API format confusion
- Started with Spatial app device ID (`a34b0f81d957d06e4aojr1`) - non-functional
- Attempted REST-style endpoints instead of action-based API
- Got "uri path invalid" errors (`code:1108`)

**Solution**: 
- Switched to Smart Life device ID (`a3e31a88528a6efc15yf4o`) - working device
- Used action-based API format with POST requests
- Correct payload structure: `{ deviceId, action: 'switch_1', value: true/false }`

### Phase 2: Tuya Cloud Timer API Attempts

**Approach**: Tried using Tuya's server-side timer system for reliability

**Issues Encountered**:
1. **Incorrect Action Names**: Used `add-timer`, `query-timers` instead of `timer.add`, `timer.list`
2. **Permission Errors**: `code:28841101` - "No permissions. This API is not subscribed"
3. **Regional Endpoint Problems**: Singapore region vs default endpoints
4. **API Complexity**: Required group management, timezone handling, complex payload structures

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Updated to correct action names (`timer.add`, `timer.list`, `timer.edit`, `timer.delete`)
- Tried different regional endpoints
- Implemented group timer management
- Created comprehensive timer payload structures

**Final Decision**: Abandoned Tuya Cloud Timers due to:
- Subscription/permission barriers
- Overly complex implementation for simple use case
- User preference for working JavaScript solution

### Phase 3: JavaScript setTimeout System

**Initial Implementation**: 
- Used `setTimeout` for scheduling future device actions
- Created timeouts for each schedule entry
- Stored timeout IDs for cleanup

**The Refresh Problem Emerges**:
- Manual device control worked initially
- Page refresh would trigger device state changes
- Problem appeared to be "zombie timeouts" from previous page loads

### Phase 4: Extensive Timeout Debugging

**Round 1: Basic Timeout Management**
```javascript
private activeTimeouts: Set<NodeJS.Timeout> = new Set();
// Track and clear timeouts on page load
```
- **Result**: Issue persisted

**Round 2: Instance-Based Protection**
```javascript
private instanceId: string = Math.random().toString(36);
// Check instance ID in timeout callbacks
if (currentInstanceId !== this.instanceId) return;
```
- **Result**: Issue persisted

**Round 3: Global Versioning System**
```javascript
let globalSchedulerVersion = Date.now();
// Invalidate timeouts from previous versions
if (currentVersion !== globalSchedulerVersion) return;
```
- **Result**: Issue persisted

**Round 4: Timestamp-Based Protection**
```javascript
const createdAt = Date.now();
if (createdAt < globalSchedulerVersion) return;
```
- **Result**: Issue persisted

**Round 5: Nuclear Timeout Clearing**
```javascript
// Clear up to 100,000 timeout IDs on startup
for (let i = startId; i <= highestId; i++) {
  clearTimeout(i);
  clearInterval(i);
}
```
- **Result**: Issue persisted - proved timeouts weren't the root cause

### Phase 5: Discovery of the Real Culprit

**The Breakthrough**: Completely disabled timeout creation
```javascript
console.log(`ðŸš« TIMEOUT SYSTEM DISABLED`);
return; // Skip all timeout creation
```
- **Result**: Issue STILL persisted - proving timeouts were innocent

**Root Cause Found**: The `syncDeviceToCurrentSchedule` function
- Function designed to "correct" device state on page load
- Would analyze current schedule and decide what device state "should be"
- If current time was after a scheduled "ON" event, it would turn device ON
- Completely ignored manual user actions

**The Problem Logic**:
```javascript
// This logic was flawed for manual override scenarios
if (entryTime <= currentTime && entryTime > lastActionTime) {
  mostRecentEntry = entry; // Device "should" be in this state
}

if (mostRecentEntry.action === 'on') {
  await tuyaAPI.turnOn(deviceId); // Overrides manual control!
}
```

### Phase 6: The Final Solution - Professional State-Based Scheduler

**New Architecture**:
1. **State-Based Scheduling**: Check every 60 seconds instead of complex timeout management
2. **Manual Override System**: Manual actions pause automatic scheduling for a period
3. **State Comparison**: Only send commands when device state differs from target
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between manual and automatic control

**Key Components**:

```javascript
// Manual override tracking
private manualOverrideUntil: number = 0;

// State checking instead of timeout chaos
private async checkAndExecuteSchedule(): Promise<void> {
  // Skip if in manual override period
  if (Date.now() < this.manualOverrideUntil) return;
  
  // Get current device state to avoid unnecessary commands
  const deviceStatus = await tuyaAPI.getDeviceStatus(deviceId);
  const currentState = deviceStatus.result?.status?.find(s => s.code === 'switch_1')?.value;
  
  if (currentState === targetState) {
    console.log(`Device already in correct state - no action needed`);
    return;
  }
}

// Manual control triggers override
async turnOn(deviceId: string, isManual: boolean = false): Promise<boolean> {
  const result = this.controlDevice(deviceId, 'switch_1', true);
  if (isManual) {
    scheduler.setManualOverride(60); // 1 hour pause
  }
  return result;
}
```

## Final Working Solution

### Architecture
- **Interval-based scheduler**: Checks every 60 seconds
- **Manual override system**: 1-hour pause after manual control
- **State validation**: Only acts when device state differs from schedule
- **Enhanced debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Key Features
1. **Manual Control Priority**: Manual actions always take precedence
2. **Smart State Checking**: Avoids unnecessary device commands
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Resumes scheduling after override period
4. **Debug Transparency**: Clear logging of all decisions

### Code Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ checkAndExecuteSchedule() - Main logic loop
â”œâ”€â”€ setManualOverride() - Pause automation
â”œâ”€â”€ startScheduleChecker() - Initialize interval
â””â”€â”€ Enhanced logging throughout
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

2. **State synchronization without user context is dangerous** - Always consider manual overrides
3. **Debugging requires elimination methodology** - Systematically disable components to isolate issues
4. **Professional systems use state-based approaches** - Not event-driven timeout chaos

### Development Process
